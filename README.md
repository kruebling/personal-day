I love the idea of this project. It took me a sec to figure out this morning what I would like to spend the day doing but I plan to work a little past 5 to make up for it.

## Classes I'm enrolled in outside of School
-Machine Learning with Python
-Building games using Unity and C#

## Projects I've Completed Outside of Class
-Reddit Bot (Node.js)
-Slack Bot (Go)
-Roll_A_Ball (C#)
-Linear Regression Model (Python)

## Goals:
-Update Resume
-HackerRank Progress
-Technical Interview Practice
-Build a Project using the Ember Framework
-Free Code Camp progress (Javascript)
-Continue Machine Learning Course
-Build a second Slack bot to utilize in our classes channel

## Progress:
*Working through hackerRank for about 2 hours. Little confused on formatting of the site. I'll present code that will pass sample test cases but I cant find the additional test cases it asks me to pass. Moving on to ember.

*Working through ember weekend homework, moving on to ember week work.

*Finished Ember Homework, moving on to Code Academy JS
