## Practice Day

I love the idea of this project. It took me a sec to figure out this morning what I would like to spend the day doing but I plan to work a little past 5 to make up for it.

## Classes I'm enrolled in outside of School
* Machine Learning with Python
* Building games using Unity and C#

## Projects I've Completed Outside of Class
* Reddit Bot (Node.js)
* Slack Bot (Go)
* Roll_A_Ball (C#)
* Linear Regression Model (Python)

# Addition Resources
* (https://inspirit.net.in/books/placements/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview.pdf)

## Goals:
* Update Resume
* HackerRank Progress
* Technical Interview Practice
* Build a Project using the Ember Framework
* Free Code Camp progress (Javascript)
* Continue Machine Learning Course
* Build a second Slack bot to utilize in our classes channel

## Progress:
* Working through hackerRank for about 2 hours. Little confused on formatting of the site. I'll present code that will pass sample test cases (screenshot) but I cant find the additional test cases it asks me to pass. If you have any advice on this site I'd love to see it. Moving on to ember.

* Working through ember weekend homework, moving on to ember week work. Really enjoyed taking the time to learn this stuff today. I'm not sure I'll use ember in next weeks project but I find ember much easier than angular to get a simple project off the ground quickly.

* Finished Ember Homework, moving on to Code Academy JS. I wanted to get a feel for Codecademy so I created an account and messed around with their intro classes on Ruby, Python and Javascript. I didn't make it as far as I would have liked in Javascript but it seems that the best parts of the class are behind a paywall. I may try a different class.

* Revisited tree house and worked a little bit more on my Ruby class. My account for Tree House is about to expire and I'm not sure I'll stick with it. I really prefer my Udemy class solely because of the pacing.

* I read through a large section of cracking the coding interview that I linked above. I'm planning to work through some of these problems and post solution code to github.

* I also spent some time today finishing my Linear Regression portion of my data science class. I'm incredibly interested in big data and the Wednesday talk inspired me to take some time to work trough it. This is a Udemy class in Python and R and I included a screenshot of my spyder page.
